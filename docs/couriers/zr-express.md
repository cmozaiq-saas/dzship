# ZR Express (Procolis) API integration guide

ZR Express, run by Procolis, is a popular choice for stores shipping from the
Algiers region. Merchants like it for the human side (reachable support,
flexible pickup); the API side is minimal but does the job: create, track,
and quote.

## What you need

From the ZR Express / Procolis dashboard:

| Credential | Field |
|---|---|
| Token | `token` |
| Key | `key` |

No other options. There's no origin-wilaya parameter and no tenant URL.

## Create a parcel

```bash
curl -X POST https://freeship.dzbuild.com/v1/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "courier": "zrexpress",
    "credentials": { "token": "YOUR_TOKEN", "key": "YOUR_KEY" },
    "order": {
      "reference": "ORD-1002",
      "recipient": {
        "fullName": "Sara Mansouri",
        "phone": "0661234567",
        "wilayaCode": 9,
        "communeName": "Blida"
      },
      "deliveryType": "home",
      "productList": "Robe été M x1",
      "codAmount": 3200
    }
  }'
```

## ZR-specific behavior

- **Exchanges**: supported; set `order.isExchange: true` when the driver should
  swap the parcel against the customer's return.
- **Stop-desk**: supported via `deliveryType: "stopdesk"`.
- **No label endpoint**: print labels from the ZR dashboard. `labelUrl` will
  not be returned.
- **No cancel endpoint**: cancel from the dashboard or by contacting ZR.
- **Confirmation matters**: ZR's workflow assumes orders are confirmed before
  pickup. Push orders after your confirmation call, not at checkout time, or
  you'll accumulate cancelled parcels on your account stats.

## The API you're being saved from

ZR's raw API is idiosyncratic: reads happen through POST requests, and at
least one core field name is misspelled *in the API itself* and must be sent
misspelled forever. This is exactly the category of trivia dzship exists to
absorb. Send the normalized request above and it comes out right on the wire.
